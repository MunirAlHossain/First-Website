        <h2>Biography</h2>
       
            <p>I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineer, having 5+ years of experience in the ICT sector in local and abroad. Due to Covid-19 pandemic situation, everything is almost stark and most of the people are trying to find out alternative ways to survive. And I think the employer will go to hire resources from the online platform, and it will impact on local job sectors. Around 20 to 30 % of employees are going to lose their job. So, I realized that the current lockdown situation is the right time to utilize my lazy days perfectly to learn something which is always exciting to me. I found "PROGRAMMING-HERO" is one of the best platforms for learning Web Development. So, I took this opportunity to learn from <strong class="real-hero">www.programming-hero.com; "which is an outstanding Institute and they are not only creating expert programmer, but also making an excellent web developer"</strong>. I am very fortunate that they enrolled me for their batch-2 programme. I hope happy learning.</p>
