        <h2>Biography</h2>
       
            <p>I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineer, having several years of experience in the ICT sector in local and abroad. Due to Covid-19 pandemic situation, everything is almost stark and people are trying to find out an alternative way to survive. So, I realize that this is the right time to utilize my days perfectly to learn something new. I found "PROGRAMMING-HERO" is one of the best platforms for Web Development. Learn something new is always exciting. One the other hand, most of the employer will hire resources from the online platform and local job will be reduced from all sectors.So, I wish to take this opportunity to learn from <strong class="real-hero">www.programming-hero.com; "which is an outstanding Institute and they are not only creating expert programmer, but also they are making an excellent web developer"</strong>. I am very fortunate that they enrolled me for their batch-2 programme. I hope happy Learing.</p>
